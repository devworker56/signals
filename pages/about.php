                    <h3 class="mb-4">The Technology</h3>
                    <p>At the core of our platform is a proprietary ensemble of machine learning models that analyze:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="mb-2">Price action and technical indicators across multiple timeframes</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">News sentiment from thousands of financial sources</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Options market activity and order flow</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Macroeconomic data releases and their market impact</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This multi-dimensional approach allows our system to identify high-probability trading opportunities that single-factor models often miss.</p>
